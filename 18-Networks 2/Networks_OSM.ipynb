    "# Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Networks are another important data structure in transportaiton.  Think roadway networks in particular, but many things can be represented as a network.  We'll go over a few basics in class. \n",
    "\n",
    "MPOs or DOTs with a travel model will maintain a network representation of the street network for use in the model.  This will have the attributes the model needs: free flow speed, capacity, length, directionality, turn restrictions, facility type, etc.  Usually, the best way to get a copy is to call up your friendly local transportation modeler and ask.  Even in this tech-crazy world, it is amazing how far asking politely will get you...\n",

    "4. Print the basic_stats for the network. \n",
